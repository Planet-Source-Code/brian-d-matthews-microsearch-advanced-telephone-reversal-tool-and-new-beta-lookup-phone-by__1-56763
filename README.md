### Description

This lets you take any phone number (if available: if its not private by customer request to their phone company) and reverse it to get their Name, Address, City, State, and Zip Code! There's not a program out there like this, and I don't want anyone copying it. It's mainly a good example to learn how to parse data, and a good way for me to share my program! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it!
